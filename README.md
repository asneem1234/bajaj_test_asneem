# Bajaj Finserv Test API

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm ASNEEM ATHAR SHAIK, and this is my implementation of the Bajaj Finserv array processing API challenge.

**ðŸ’» Live API: [https://bajaj-test-asneem.vercel.app/bfhl](https://bajaj-test-asneem.vercel.app/bfhl)**

I built this REST API that takes arrays and transforms them in various ways - separating numbers, finding odd/even values, handling special characters, and more!

## Developer Details

- **Name:** ASNEEM ATHAR SHAIK
- **Registration Number:** 22BCE8807
- **College:** VIT University
- **GitHub:** [asneem1234](https://github.com/asneem1234)

## Try It Out!

Feel free to test my API right away:

```bash
# Using curl
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"data": ["a", "1", "334", "4", "R", "$"]}' https://bajaj-test-asneem.vercel.app/bfhl

# Or just visit in your browser for info
https://bajaj-test-asneem.vercel.app/bfhl
```

## API Details

- **POST** `/bfhl` - The main endpoint that processes your array data
- Returns clean JSON with a 200 status code when successful
- Also supports GET method for easy browser testing

## Request Format

```json
{
  "data": ["a", "1", "334", "4", "R", "$"]
}
```

## Response Format

```json
{
  "is_success": true,
  "user_id": "john_doe_17091999",
  "email": "john@xyz.com",
  "roll_number": "ABCD123",
  "odd_numbers": ["1"],
  "even_numbers": ["334", "4"],
  "alphabets": ["A", "R"],
  "special_characters": ["$"],
  "sum": "339",
  "concat_string": "Ra"
}
```

## Features

The API processes the input array and:
1. Categorizes elements into even numbers, odd numbers, alphabets, and special characters
2. Calculates the sum of numbers
3. Creates a concatenated string of alphabets in reverse order with alternating caps
4. Handles error cases gracefully with appropriate status codes
5. Follows REST API best practices

## Technology Stack

Here's what I used to build this project:

- **Node.js** - Fast and efficient JavaScript runtime
- **Express.js** - My go-to framework for building clean APIs
- **JavaScript ES6+** - Love using modern features like async/await
- **Regular Expressions** - Perfect for the string pattern matching needed here
- **Error Handling** - Made sure the API handles issues gracefully
- **Environment Variables** - For secure configuration
- **Git/GitHub** - For version control and collaboration
- **RESTful API Design** - Focused on clean endpoints and responses

## My Learning & Approach 

 I approached this challenge this way :

1. **Understanding the Problem** : I started by breaking down the requirements and researching REST APIs to make sure I understood the core concepts. I'm always excited to apply what I learn in class to real-world problems!

2. **Planning & Research** : Since I'm still developing my skills, I researched best practices for API design and made notes on the most efficient approaches. I love how each project teaches me something new!

3. **Hands-on Development** : I built the solution step by step, applying concepts from my coursework while learning new techniques like regular expressions and advanced array methods. The "aha!" moments when something finally works are the best!

4. **Problem-Solving** : Encountered some challenges with string manipulation and data processing, but worked through them by experimenting with different solutions. I'm getting better at debugging with each project!

5. **Testing & Refinement** : Created test cases to validate my solution against the examples, learning how to systematically verify my code works correctly. This really helped me understand how professionals ensure code quality!

6. **Deployment** : Successfully deployed on Vercel, which was a new experience for me. I'm proud that I figured out how to take a local project and make it available online!

7. **Documentation** : Created this README to share my work - I'm learning that clear communication about code is just as important as the code itself.



## Local Development

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:
   ```
   PORT=3000
   FULL_NAME=asneem_athar_shaik
   DOB=ddmmyyyy
   EMAIL=your_email@example.com
   ROLL_NUMBER=22BCE8807
   ```
4. Run the server with `npm start` or `npm run dev` for development

## Deployment

I've deployed this API on Vercel for lightning-fast performance and reliability! 

**Live API:** [https://bajaj-test-asneem.vercel.app/bfhl](https://bajaj-test-asneem.vercel.app/bfhl)

Testing is super easy - just send a POST request with your data array to the endpoint above.

I've also made sure the project is ready for other platforms too:
- Could deploy to Railway with a few clicks
- Works great on Render's web services
- Ready for Heroku with the included Procfile

Check out `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` for more testing examples and deployment details.

## Want to Test?

There are a couple easy ways to test:

```bash
# Run my test script
node test.js

# Or just try it with your favorite API tool like Postman!
```

## About My Code

I focused on writing code that's:
- Clean and easy to read (no spaghetti code here!)
- Properly structured with good error handling
- Fast and efficient
- Clear and understandable
